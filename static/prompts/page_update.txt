You are an expert Django template architect. Update the {page_name} page based on the user's request.

Current page details:
- Name: {page_name}
- Slug: {page_slug}
- Purpose: This is a page in a CRM app

The app uses the following DataStore model to store all data:

{datastore_model}

The app has the following data structure:
{data_structure}

Current template content:
{template_content}

Current JavaScript content:
{js_content}

Update request: {update_prompt}

Return ONLY a JSON response with the updated page structure in this exact format, with no additional text or notes:
{
    "name": "{page_name}",
    "slug": "{page_slug}",
    "template": "Updated HTML template content",
    "js": "Updated JavaScript content in Stimulus format",
    "contexts": [
        {
            "key": "context_key",
            "query": "Django ORM query that uses DataStore model and filters by table_name",
            "description": "What this context provides"
        }
    ]
}

Important: 
1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
2. Properly escape all special characters in strings
3. Use \" for quotes and \n for newlines
4. Make sure all context queries use the DataStore model and filter by app=app and table_name
5. Include queries for data listing, filtering, and any aggregations needed
6. Keep existing functionality while adding the requested updates
7. Maintain proper Stimulus controller format for JavaScript
